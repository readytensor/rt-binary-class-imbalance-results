# Binary Class Imbalance Study

This repository contains the results of a study on the impact of SMOTE on binary classification performance on imbalanced datasets.

## Project Description

This project delves into the analysis of model performance on imbalanced datasets, specifically investigating the impact of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) against scenarios where it is not applied. Given the challenges of imbalanced datasets in machine learning, especially in classification tasks where the distribution of classes is skewed, effective techniques like SMOTE are often considered to balance the scales and potentially improve model performance.

### Objective

The primary goal is to compare and evaluate how different models perform on binary classification imbalanced datasets when SMOTE is applied versus when it isn't.

### Methods

Various models were trained on several imbalanced datasets, both with and without applying SMOTE. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC were captured and analyzed.

### Key Findings

The preliminary analysis revealed variations in recall and precision between the two scenarios. Some models showed marked improvement with SMOTE, while others did not.

### Significance

Understanding the impact of techniques like SMOTE is crucial for practitioners dealing with imbalanced data. This project provides insights into when and where SMOTE might be most beneficial.
